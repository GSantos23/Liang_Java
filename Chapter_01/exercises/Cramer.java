/*
 * Exercise 1.12 
 * (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the 
 * following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
 * ax + by = e, cx + dy = f, x = (ed - bf)/ (ad - bc), y = (af - ec) / (ad - bc)
 * Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x 
 * and y :
 * 		3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 * 		2.1x + .55y = 5.9
